              <EM>Entire Agreement</EM>. These Terms constitute the entire and
              exclusive understanding and agreement between Bluesky and you
              regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and
              replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements
              between Bluesky and you regarding the Services and Content. If any
              provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an
              arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision
              will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other
              provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
              You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or
              otherwise, without Bluesky&rsquo;s prior written consent. Any
              attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such
              consent, will be null. Bluesky may freely assign or transfer these
              Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms
              will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their
              successors and permitted assigns.

              <EM>Notices</EM>. Any notices or other communications provided by
              Bluesky under these Terms will be given: (i)&nbsp;via email; or
              (ii)&nbsp;by posting to the Services. For notices made by email,
              the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice
              is transmitted.

            <LI>
              <EM>Waiver of Rights</EM>. Bluesky&rsquo;s failure to enforce any
              right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver
              of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
              provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a
              duly authorized representative of Bluesky. Except as expressly set
              forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its
              remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
              remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
